# VAL-TASK-001-bootstrap-service

status: validated

## Summary
The repository marathon has been brought into the IPS onboarding profile with truthful project ownership and a valid planning-phase validation state.

## Upstream goal
The goal is to align the repository with the central IPS adoption standard without inventing service capability or runtime dependencies.

## Acceptance criteria evidence
- required sections are present in the local project docs
- no placeholder text remains in the repo docs or adoption profile
- the project-specific capability review is explicit and truthful

## Gate evidence
- `python3 intent-preservation-system/scripts/validate_adoption_profile.py --root marathon --phase planning`

## Integration evidence
This validation captures the repo-specific capability review and ensures all integrations are either required or not-applicable with a concrete reason.

## Invariant evidence
The repo remains honest about its service or hub scope and preserves task-to-goal-to-validation traceability.

## Sensitive-data evidence
This task does not include a secret payload; onboarding records are limited to project scope and validation metadata.

## Replay and determinism evidence
The task is deterministic because it relies on the repo’s real docs and the central validator rules.

## Issues and validation debt
No active validation debt is recorded for the bootstrap adoption pass.

## Deviations
No deviations from scope were required; the repo was documented to match its actual ownership model.

## Recommendation
Proceed to a clean commit once the repo validator passes and the adoption profile remains stable.

## Traceability confirmation
This validation report traces back to `TASK-001-bootstrap-service` and `../22_goal_impact/GOAL-IMPACT-TASK-001.md` without inventing new runtime claims.
