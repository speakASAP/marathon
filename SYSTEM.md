completeness_level: complete
status: validated

## Purpose
Marathon service for scheduling, participant coordination, and operational event tracking within the Alfares ecosystem.

## Responsibilities
- maintain the project-specific operational contract for the repository
- document the true runtime, tooling, or hub scope of the project
- keep project invariants and validation debt honest and reviewable
- preserve a link between the project and the shared IPS standard without copying it

## Non-responsibilities
- describing a runtime capability that is not actually owned by the repository
- inventing ecosystem integrations for a hub, research, or documentation-only repo
- bypassing project validation by asserting made-up evidence

## Inputs
- repository-local intent, docs, and operational artefacts
- shared Alfares ecosystem standards and routing conventions
- project-specific deployment and validation requirements when the repo owns a live service

## Outputs
- project adoption profile and traceable task plan
- truthful capability review for required and not-applicable integrations
- documentation and validation evidence that matches the actual project boundary

## Dependencies
- shared IPS repository for standards and validators
- ecosystem runtime services only when the repository genuinely owns them
- project-local code, configuration, and deployment metadata when present

## Upstream traceability
- intent-preservation-system standard and validation rules
- ecosystem deployment conventions and service ownership model

## Downstream artifacts
- README, TASKS.md, STATE.json, and validation records
- project governance docs and approval evidence
- repo-specific runtime or tooling documentation when applicable

## Validation criteria
- the project validator exits successfully at planning phase
- required sections exist in each IPS artifact
- no placeholder text or fabricated evidence remains in the adoption profile
- every capability is reviewed with a concrete reason

## Open questions
- confirm any live deployment or runtime boundary not explicitly stated in the repository docs
- verify whether the project remains active, low-priority, or documentation-led at the time of the next governance review
